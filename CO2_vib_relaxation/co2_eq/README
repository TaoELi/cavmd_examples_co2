# This simulation should be the first of simulation.
# After simulation, we can plot the equilibrium IR spectrum.

- 1. Submit jobs

qsub submit_diabatical_incav.sh
qsub submit_diabatical_outcav.sh

For both scripts, they will work on the folder Global_path=./ (the current folder).

Please change the folder to the one you want to store the simulation raw data. Please also change the PBS environment accordingly.

- 2. After the end of simulation, we want to obtain the IR spectrum. This can be obtained by

python collect_all_data_tdIR.py E0_0e-4/ E0_2e-4/

Here, E0_0e-4/ and E0_2e-4/ are the folders that CavMD generates in the folder Global_path/, and E0 means the effective light-matter coupling strength (in atomic units).

This python script will generate many files, we need files end with \*dac.txt to generate IR spectrum.


- 3. Finally, please ensure that in the current folder, we have subfolders ./E0_0e-4/ and ./E0_2e-4/. In each subfolder, we have files:

a. \*dac.txt
b. init*.checkpoint

The "init*.checkpoint" files are generated by CavMD, which store equilibrium geometries of the system. They will be used as starting configurations in nonequilibrium simulations.

All other files in E0_0e-4/ or E0_2e-4/ can be safely deleted.
