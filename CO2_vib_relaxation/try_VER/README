# This simulation relies on the completion of ../co2_eq/ simulations.
# After finishing the jobs in this folder, we can plot (i) cavity effects on vibrational energy relaxation and transfer and (ii) detuning effect on vibrational relaxation rates.

- 1. We create a folder to store the initial geometries of the simulation. These initial geometries come from ../co2_eq/E0_0e-4/ folder

mkdir equilibrium_configs/
cp ../co2_eq/E0_0e-4/init*checkpoint equilibrium_configs/

- 2. We want to increase the kinetic energy of a few (10) molecules. These molecules will later be called the "hot molecules". Likewise, the molecules staying at equilibrium will be called the "thermal molecules". We are interested in how vibrational energy relaxation of the hot molecules is modified by vibrational strong coupling.

python change_initial_condition_exc_10.py equilibrium_configs/init*.checkpoint

This python script will modify the kinetic energy of 10 molecules in equilibrium_configs/init*checkpoint files and store the modified nonequilibrium configurations to modified_configs_exc_10/

- 3. Given the initial nonequilibrium geometries stored in modified_configs_exc_10/, we can perform CavMD simualtions

qsub submit_diabatical_exc_10.sh

This simulation studies the effect of switching on/off the resonant light-matter coupling on vibrational relaxation and energy transfer.

qsub submit_diabatical_detuning.sh

This simulation studies the effect of cavity mode detuning on vibrational relaxation and energy transfer.

- 4. After finishing the simulations, we want to obtain some useful information, including photonic dynamics and C=O bond potential energy for the hot and thermal molecules.

python collect_all_data_vco.py Exc_10_E0_*/ Freq_*/

Here, Exc_10_E0_*/ are generated by submit_diabatical_exc_10.sh, and Freq_*/ are generated by submit_diabatical_detuning.sh.

- 5. We also provide the equilibrium and nonequilibrium initial configruations as a tarball. Please

tar -xvf data_initial.tar.gz

if you want to skip step 1-2 and want to obtain the nonequilibrium dynamics directly.
