# This simulation relies on completing the CavMD simulations in ../co2_eq/ and ../try_VER/ folders
# Upon finishing the current simualtions as shown below, we can plot the vibrational realxation rate versus molecualr concentration.

- 1. perform equilibrium simulation by changing some CO2 molecules to the isotope form

./prepare_initial_configs.sh

- 2. perform nonequilibrium simulation by setting 10 CO2 molecules as hot molecules

./prepare_vr_configs.sh

- 3. We need obtain C=O bond energy dynamics of nonequilibrium simulation, and IR from equilibrium simulations

cp ../try_VER/collect_all_data_vco.py .
