# This simulation will generate xyz files for 2000 molecules under VSC, so please ensure your disk space is large enough...

The initial geometries for this nonequilibrium simulation and data available for plotting can be obtained by

tar -xvf data_all.tar.gz

1. If you want to perform the simulation, after the extract files from the tarball, please run

qsub submit_diabatical_exc_accordingly.sh

2. Then, please output the C=O bond energy distribution for all thermal molecules using:

python collect_all_data_vco.py Exc*/
