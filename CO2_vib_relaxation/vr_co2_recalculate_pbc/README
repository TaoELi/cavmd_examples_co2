# This bulky simulation studies the cavity effect versus the system size.
# After finishing this job, we can plot cavity effect versus (i) Nhot and (ii) molecular system size

1. prepare equilibrium configurations under different system sizes

./prepare_eq_files.sh

This command relies on:

packmol [http://leandro.iqm.unicamp.br/m3g/packmol/home.shtml] and
moltemplate.sh [https://www.moltemplate.org/]

Please ensure these two commands can be normally operated in your system.

2. submit equilibrium simualtions

./submit_eq_files.sh

3. prepare nonequilibrium simulations after the completion of step 2 (It may take more than a week...)

./prepare_vr_files_Nhot_increase.sh

This script prepares nonequilibrium geometries with different Nhot (Nsub=2160)

./prepare_vr_files_Nhot_10.sh

This script prepares nonequilibrium geometries with different Nsub (Nhot = 10)

./prepare_vr_files_Nhot_ratio_10.sh

This script prepares nonequilibrium geometries with different Nsub (Nhot/Nsub = 10/216 remains the same)

4. submit the nonequilibrium simulations accordingly (it can take more than one week...)

./submit_vr_files_Nhot_increase.sh

./submit_vr_files_Nhot_10.sh

./submit_vr_files_Nhot_ratio_10.sh

5. After the finish of all simulations, please run 

./capture_avg_data.sh

to obtain all necessary output for plotting.


One important info of this simulation is that, because here we simulate up to a large number of molecules (10^4), it is not a good idea to directly output xyz files and then do analysis.

a. In equilibrium simulations, we only output *checkpoint files, which store the current configuration only and will be used in nonequilibrium simulations.

b. In nonequilibrium simulations, we output (i) C=O bond energy per hot molecule and (ii) photonic coordinates in simu*.out.

As shown in vr_template/input_traj.xml.bak, we output the following three info

usr_defined_quantity{atomic_unit}, atom_x(648){angstrom}, atom_x(649){angstrom}

Here, vr_template/usr_defined_function.py.bak defines how to calculate the C=O bond energy per hot molecule.

atom_x(648) and atom_x(649) [index starting from 0] denotes the last two "atoms", which are the cavity photons polarized along x and y directions.
