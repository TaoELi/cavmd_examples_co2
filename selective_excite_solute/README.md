# CavMD simulations of selectively exciting solute molecules via solvent vibration-polariton pumping

This folder contains all necessary files for reproducing the following paper:

- Li, T. E.; Nitzan, A.; Subotnik, J. E. Energy-efficient pathway for selectively exciting solute molecules to high vibrational states via solvent vibration-polariton pumping. [arXiv 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.15121).

Similar as previous work, we just need to go to each folder and submit the bash files, and then run the plot*.py scripts to obtain the figures in the manuscript.

1. **equilibrium_simulation/** contains files for equilibrium simulations with 216 molecules;

2. **equilibrium_simulation_pbc/** contains files for equilibrium simulations with more than 216 molecules;

3. **pumping_LP_simulation/** contains files for nonequilibrium simulations with 216 molecules after the solvent LP pumping;

4. **pumping_LP_simulation_pbc/** contains files for nonequilibrium simulations with more than 216 molecules after the solvent LP pumping;

5. **plot*.py** describes how to reproduce the figures in the manuscript.
